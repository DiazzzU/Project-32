# Project-32
## Duration: August, 1st - August, 31st 
## Description:
- This project's purpose is to estimate the number of people who would like to use Mathematica during their studies at the Innopolis University.
- You can participate iff you are an Innopolis student and want to get a [Mathematica|Desktop Student license](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/pricing/students/).
- As the outcome, we expect to create a community of students who know how to apply Mathematica in real studies and a set of solutions on which one can study Mathematica capabilities.
## Rules:
#### Submission 
- You submit the projects written in Mathematica notebooks(.nb extension) to this repository via pull requests. All of your projects will be stored in separate folders whose names should be relevant to your project.
- You are allowed to submit one work only.
#### Accepted works
- The accepted works will appear in repo after being reviewed by the project's curators. This may take up to several days.
- If curators see some flaws in your submission, they may notify you, so check github regularly after submission.
- All reviewed works will appear by the end of the project.
- Iff there are more than 2/3 * 32 works accepted, all participants whose works were accepted will be awarded with Mathematica Desktop + Online.
#### Notebook's content
- Your notebook should follow the template in the repo, see template.nb. For submission, just change it where necessary and delete the comments.
- Your notebook should contain the name of your project, your goal, code, comments where necessary, what you have achieved. Please be as clear as possible. If we don't explicitly state something, you choose what to do on your own.
#### Choosing the problem
- As you can see, the project lasts only for one month. Hence, you probably won't be able to implement something extremely difficult, and some parts of Mathematica may not work at some moment.
- So you may choose a problem that you had to solve during your courses with pencil and paper or with Python or anyhow else and implement its solution in Mathematica. It would be nice if you additionally compare the time you spent on these two approaches and the performance of you Python/Mathematica implementations and provide  both solutions in separate subfolders of your folder
#### Contacts
- If you'd like to contact Project 32's organizers, you can write to n.shilov@innopolis.ru or create a corresponding issue in the repo with the name of your project as its title
