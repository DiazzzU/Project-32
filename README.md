# Project-32
## Duration: November, 15th - November, 29th 
## Description:
- This project's purpose is to estimate the number of people who would like to use Mathematica during their studies at the Innopolis University.
- You can participate iff you are an Innopolis student. Moreover, if you are taking the DE course now, you can earn up to 4 points for an accepted project!
- As the outcome, we expect to create a community of students who know how to apply Mathematica and a set of solutions on which one can study capabilities of this CAS.

## Rules:
#### Submission 
- For implementation of your project, you may use [Mathematica's Free Trial version](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/)
- You submit the links to your project via Telegram. Contact repo owners: either [Danila](https://t.me/daniladanko) or [Zakhar](https://t.me/ZYagudin). These links will be shown below, in the Suggested projects section.
- You are allowed to choose one project only.
#### Acceptance criteria
- Your notebook should contain the name of your project, your goal, code, comments where necessary, and what you have achieved. Please be as clear as possible. 
- A couple of projects made by us will be uploaded by the start of the project.
- Note that if we don't explicitly state something, you choose what to do on your own.
#### Accepted works
- The accepted works will appear in repo after being reviewed by the project's curators. Be patient, the review process may take up to several days!
- We will add to this project's repository all reviewed works by the end of the project.
#### Choosing a problem
- As you can see, the project lasts only for two weeks. Hence, you probably won't be able to implement something extremely difficult, and some parts of Mathematica may not work at some stage.
- You can change your project at any moment, if there are available projects (their names in the Suggested projects will contain no links). 
- Anyway, if you're choosing a project, contact any repo owner in Telegram! Write your current project's name (if you have already booked any) and which one do you want to choose. We will change links so that your new project looks "booked".
#### Contacts
- You may join the project's group [@project32_group](https://t.me/project32_group) in Telegram. "We encourage vigorous discussion and cooperation"Â©
